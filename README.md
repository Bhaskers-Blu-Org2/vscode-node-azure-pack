* The [Docker Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker) make it easy to develop and deploy containerized micro-service based applications using Docker containers. 

* The [Azure CLI Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli) provide an enhanced editing experience when authoring Azure CLI 2.0 commands, with full completions (IntelliSense), the ability to invoke one or more commands in the terminal, and the ability to easily view and format results as a separate JSON document.

* The [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) provide a rich editing experience for Azure Resource Manager deployment templates and template language expressions. For example, IntelliSense for TLE function names, parameter references, signature help, GoTo Definition, Peek Definitions, and Find All References (Shift+F12) as well as Errors and Warnings, making it quick and easy to author ARM templates in VS Code.

## Installation

VS Code will ask you if you want to install all of this extension's dependencies, which are all of the great extensions listed above (so say yes!). In addition, some of these extensions will also install the [Azure Account extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) which provides a single Azure login and subscription filtering experience.
